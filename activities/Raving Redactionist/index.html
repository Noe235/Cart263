    <h2> Top Secret</h2>
  <div class="glasses">
      <p id="1">
        Glasses are really <span class="revealed top-secret">versatile.</span>
      </p>
      <p id="2">
        First, you can have glasses-wearing girls take them off and suddenly <span class="redacted top-secret">
        become beautiful</span>, or have girls wearing glasses<span class="redacted top-secret"> flashing those cute grins, </span>
        or have girls<span class="redacted top-secret"> stealing the protagonist's</span> glasses and putting them on like,
        <span class="redacted top-secret">"Haha, got your glasses!"</span> That's just way too <span class="redacted top-secret">cute!</span>
      </p>
      <p id="3">
        Also,<span class="redacted top-secret"> boys with glasses!</span> I really like when their glasses have that suspicious
        looking gleam, and <span class="redacted top-secret">it's amazing how it can look really cool</span> or just be<span class="redacted top-secret"> a joke.</span>
        I really like how it can<span class="redacted top-secret"> fulfill all those abstract needs.</span>
      </p>
      <p id="4">
        Being able to<span class="redacted top-secret"> switch up the styles</span> and <span class="redacted top-secret">colors of glasses</span> based on your <span class="redacted top-secret">mood</span>
        is a lot of fun too! <span class="redacted top-secret">It's actually so much fun! </span> You have those <span class="redacted top-secret">half rim</span> glasses,
        or the <span class="redacted top-secret">thick frame </span>glasses, everything! It's like you're enjoying all these kinds
        of glasses at<span class="redacted top-secret"> a buffet.</span>
      </p>
      <p id="5"> I really want<span class="redacted top-secret"> Pippin to try others styles</span> or <span class="redacted top-secret">Sharon to try
        some on to replace her curent</span> ones. We really need <span class="redacted top-secret">glasses to become a thing</span> in
        <span class="redacted top-secret">CART 263 </span> and start selling them for<span class="redacted top-secret"> all the CART class.</span>
      </p>
      <p id="6"> Don't. You. Think. We. Really. Need. To. Officially. Give. Everyone. Glasses?

      Do it! Just do it! Don't let your dreams be dreams. Yesterday, you said tomorrow. So just do it! Make your dreams come true!
    </p>
      <p id="8">

      Just do it! <span class="redacted top-secret">Some people dream of success</span>, while you're gonna wake up and work hard at it! Nothing is<span class="redacted top-secret"> impossible!</span>
    </p>
      <p id="9"> You should get to the point where anyone<span class="redacted top-secret"> else would quit,</span> and you're not gonna stop there!

    </p>
      <p id="10">
         No, what are you waiting for?<span class="redacted top-secret"> Do it! </span>Just do it! Yes you can! Just do it.

      <p id="12">
        Basically, the Niagara Falls is, like,<span class="redacted top-secret"> a tourist attraction</span> that is between both America and Canada. Oh my God, I almost said Canadia. Oh my God imagine<span class="redacted top-secret"> being Canadian</span> and saying Canadia, ah, couldn't be me.
      </p>
      <p id="13"> Anyway, so, the<span class="redacted top-secret"> only difference</span> is that the Canada side is like actually really really pretty, but the American side is just one like <span class="redacted top-secret">little streamline</span> of water and they're like "Yeah, this is our Niagara Falls."
      </p>
      <p id="14"> But like honestly, that's like,<span class="redacted top-secret"> kinda lame?</span> And as someone who's only ever gone to the, like, Niagara Falls ever like once, because that shit's far as fuck, like who the fuck would go there in their<span class="redacted top-secret"> free time</span> ever as a Canadian?
      </p>
      <p id="15"> Like I dunno,<span class="redacted top-secret"> that's not me,</span> but like, like, yo America? You gotta up your game a little bit 'cause the Niagara Falls are kinda wild.
