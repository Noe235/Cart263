    <h2> Top Secret</h2>
      <p>
        Glasses are really <span class="revealed top-secret">versatile.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        First, you can have glasses-wearing girls take them off and suddenly <span class="redacted top-secret">
        become beautiful</span>, or have girls wearing glasses<span class="redacted top-secret"> flashing those cute grins, </span>
        or have girls<span class="redacted top-secret"> stealing the protagonist's</span> glasses and putting them on like,
        <span class="redacted top-secret">"Haha, got your glasses!"</span> That's just way too <span class="redacted top-secret">cute!</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also,<span class="redacted top-secret"> boys with glasses!</span> I really like when their glasses have that suspicious
        looking gleam, and <span class="redacted top-secret">it's amazing how it can look really cool</span> or just be<span class="redacted top-secret"> a joke.</span>
        I really like how it can<span class="redacted top-secret"> fulfill all those abstract needs.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Being able to<span class="redacted top-secret"> switch up the styles</span> and <span class="redacted top-secret">colors of glasses</span> based on your <span class="redacted top-secret">mood</span>
        is a lot of fun too! <span class="redacted top-secret">It's actually so much fun! </span> You have those <span class="redacted top-secret">half rim</span> glasses,
        or the <span class="redacted top-secret">thick frame </span>glasses, everything! It's like you're enjoying all these kinds
        of glasses at<span class="redacted top-secret"> a buffet.</span> I really want<span class="redacted top-secret"> Pippin to try others styles</span> or <span class="redacted top-secret">Sharon to try
        some on to replace her curent</span> ones. We really need <span class="redacted top-secret">glasses to become a thing</span> in
        <span class="redacted top-secret">CART 263 </span> and start selling them for<span class="redacted top-secret"> all the CART class.</span>
      </p>
      <p> Don't. You. Think. We. Really. Need. To. Officially. Give. Everyone. Glasses?
