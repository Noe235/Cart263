# The Dumbest Quiz
Artist's Statement
This project was heavily inspired by "The Impossible Quiz" game. The goal was to deepen my understanding of the jquery and jquery.ui libraries.  Since these libraries are focused on HTML, I wanted the gameplay to be focused, on interacting with words. There was no specific aesthetic vision for this project. It had the basics of being pleasant to read and readable while looking silly as well. Similar to "The Impossible Quiz", I used certain knowledge and question that are the ones I have heard when I was young meaning very Quebec culture. These questions are somewhat playing with meaning which can make them appear dumb, and enhance the name of the game.

I believe I manage to learn well in the libraries I choose. The part that I think works the best and is the most pleasant is the giraffe question. I  believe it was fun to play with the words that way, but it was the most difficult to fix if there are errors. I manage to make 10 levels, but I believe more can easily be implemented as most of the skeletons for levels that are similar are present. I considered adding more libraries to add more gameplay as the game would only benefit if more libraries are implemented, but I didn't have time to add it.
